# Samuel's MAS `custom_bgm` Collection

My personal background music collection for Monika After Story

## How to use custom music as background music in Monika After Story?

1. Go to your installation folder of Monika After Story
2. Create a new directory / folder named `custom_bgm`, word for word. You might already have that. The folder is in the same directory / folder as `DDLC.exe`.
3. Put your desired music into the folder, both .mp3 and .ogg audio format works

## What musics are in this collection?

1. `DDLC OST`: These are the Original Soundtrack from Doki Doki Literature Club that are not already in MAS as background music. Ex. My Confession, My Feelings, Sayo-nara are not included.
2. `DDLC+ OST`: These are Original Soundtrack from Doki Doki Literature Club Plus. This includes every DDLC+ OST and one file that contains every DDLC+ music as a playlist.
3. `DDLC Remix`: These are some of the best remixes of DDLC music, most of them are instrumental (without a singer). Credits of these musics go to their respective artists.
