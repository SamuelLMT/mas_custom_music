# Samuel's MAS `custom_bgm` Collection

My personal background music collection for Monika After Story

## How to use custom music as background music in Monika After Story?

1. Go to your installation folder of Monika After Story
2. Create a new directory / folder named `custom_bgm`, word for word. You might already have that. `custom_bgm` is in the same directory / folder as `DDLC.exe`.
3. Put your desired music into the folder, both .mp3 and .ogg audio format works

## What musics are in this collection?

1. `DDLC OST`: These are the Original Soundtrack from Doki Doki Literature Club that are not already in MAS as background music. Ex. My Confession, My Feelings, Sayo-nara are not included.
2. `DDLC+ OST`: These are Original Soundtrack from Doki Doki Literature Club Plus. This includes every DDLC+ OST and one file that contains every DDLC+ music as a playlist.
3. `DDLC Remix`: These are some of the best remixes of DDLC music, most of them are instrumental (without a singer). Credits of these musics go to their respective artists.

## How to I download these musics?

1. Go on the computer that your Monika is in (Hopefully you are reading this from that computer already)
2. Click the `Code` Dropdown in the top right corner of this GitHub page
3. Click `Download Zip`
4. Open the Zip file (with a program like WinRAR, 7-Zip, or File Explorer), and drag the .ogg files into your `custom_bgm` directory
5. Open MAS, or if your MAS is already opened, ask Monika: "Can you check for new Music?"
